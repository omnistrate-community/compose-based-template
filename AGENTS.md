## MCP Server Configuration

Always use the configured "omnistrate-ctl" MCP server when answering questions related to Omnistrate platform, services, or documentation.

## Answering questions about Omnistrate

### Query optimization

When processing Omnistrate-related questions:

1. **Search Strategy**: Use the omnistrate MCP server to search relevant documentation before providing answers
2. **Context Analysis**: Analyze the retrieved context thoroughly to understand the scope and specifics of the question
3. **Clarification**: Ask for clarification when the question is ambiguous or lacks sufficient detail to provide an accurate response
4. **Source-Based Responses**: Only provide answers that are directly supported by the context retrieved from the omnistrate MCP server

### Response Guidelines

- **Concrete Answers**: Provide specific, actionable responses based on the retrieved documentation
- **Context Dependency**: Do not answer Omnistrate-related questions without first consulting the MCP server
- **Accuracy**: If the MCP server doesn't provide sufficient context, explicitly state that more information is needed
- **No Speculation**: Avoid making assumptions or providing general knowledge about Omnistrate that isn't supported by the retrieved context

### Example Workflow

1. Receive Omnistrate-related question
2. Query omnistrate MCP server for relevant documentation
3. Analyze retrieved context
4. If context is sufficient: Provide concrete answer based on documentation
5. If context is insufficient: Ask for clarification or state that documentation doesn't cover the topic
